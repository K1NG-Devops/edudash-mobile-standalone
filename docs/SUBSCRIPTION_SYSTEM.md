## üîß Technical Implementation

### Service Layer
```typescript
import { SubscriptionService } from '@/lib/services/subscriptionService';

// Get all available plans
const plans = await SubscriptionService.getSubscriptionPlans();

// Get user's current subscription
const subscription = await SubscriptionService.getUserSubscription(userId);

// Create new subscription
const newSubscription = await SubscriptionService.createSubscription({
  userId,
  planId,
  billingInterval: 'monthly',
  paymentProvider: 'payfast'
});

// Get analytics
const analytics = await SubscriptionService.getSubscriptionAnalytics();
```

### React Native Hook
```typescript
import { useSubscription } from '@/lib/hooks/useSubscription';

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    subscription,     // Current user subscription
    plans,           // Available plans
    loading,         // Loading state
    error,          // Error state
    createSubscription,
    cancelSubscription,
    isSubscribed,
    canUpgrade,
    canDowngrade
  } = useSubscription();

  return (
    <View>
      {plans.map(plan => (
        <PlanCard 
          key={plan.id} 
          plan={plan}
          onSelect={() => createSubscription(plan.id)}
        />
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}
```

const { isSubscribed, subscription } = useSubscription();

{isSubscribed ? (
  <PremiumContent />
) : (
  <TrialBanner plan={subscription?.plan} />
)}
```

### Plan Upgrade Flow
```typescript
const { canUpgrade, upgradeTo } = useSubscription();

<Button 
  onPress={() => upgradeTo('premium')}
  disabled={!canUpgrade('premium')}
>
  Upgrade to Pro
</Button>
```
