# EduDash Pro Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 21 Aug 2025

EduDash Pro ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard personal information when you use our mobile and web applications (the "Services").

## Information We Collect
- Account information such as name, email address, and role (e.g., principal, teacher, parent)
- School and student information provided by authorized school staff
- Usage data such as device information, app interactions, and diagnostic logs
- Optional media you upload (e.g., photos or documents for homework submissions)

### Camera and Media Access
With your permission, EduDash Pro may access your device camera and photo library to allow users to:
- Capture or upload photos of homework or classroom activities
- Attach files to messages or submissions

Photos and files are used only for the selected feature and are uploaded securely to our managed storage. We do not access your camera or media without explicit user action, and we do not collect biometric data.

## How We Use Information
- Provide and improve the Services, including classroom, homework, and communication features
- Authenticate users and enforce role-based access controls
- Ensure platform security, fraud prevention, and abuse monitoring
- Comply with legal requirements and protect user rights

## Legal Basis
We process personal data based on legitimate interests of providing educational services, performance of a contract with schools or users, compliance with legal obligations, and consent where required (e.g., camera access).

## Data Sharing
We do not sell personal information. We share data only with:
- Service providers (e.g., hosting, email delivery) bound by confidentiality and data protection terms
- Authorized school administrators within your institution
- Authorities if required by law, court order, or to protect rights and safety

## Data Security
We implement technical and organizational measures to protect data, including encryption in transit and at rest, role-based access controls, and audit logging. Despite this, no system is 100% secure.

## Data Retention
We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services and for legitimate business or legal purposes. Schools may request deletion of data consistent with applicable laws and contractual commitments.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy
EduDash Pro is used by schools and parents to manage pre-primary education. Student data is provided and managed by schools and parents. We do not knowingly collect data directly from children without parental or school oversight.

## Your Rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal information. Please contact your school administrator or us to exercise these rights.

## International Transfers
Data may be stored or processed in regions outside your country. We use appropriate safeguards for international data transfers.
