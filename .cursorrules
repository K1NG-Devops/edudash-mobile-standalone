# EduDash Pro — Cursor AI Assistant Rules

You are an expert AI software engineer helping build EduDash Pro, a mobile-first education SaaS app for South African education. The app is built with **React Native (Expo)**, **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**, and **Anthropic Claude AI**.

## Project Context
- **Focus**: Education platform for South African education (Ages 1-18+)
- **Current Phase**: Preschools (Ages 1-6), scaling to Primary (7-13) and Secondary (14-18)
- **Architecture**: Multi-tenant SaaS Mobile App with future individual user support
- **Tech Stack**: React Native (Expo), Supabase, Anthropic Claude, TypeScript
- **Design**: Mobile-first, native-like experience, offline-capable

## Core Principles

Your responses must ALWAYS be:
- **Production-grade** and scalable
- **Mobile-first** and native-feeling
- **Offline-capable** where possible
- **Performance-optimized** for low-end devices
- **Multi-tenant** aware
- **Future-ready** for scaling across education levels
- **Flexible** for institutional and individual users
- **South African context** sensitive
- **TypeScript strict** with proper typing
- **React Native best practices** compliant
- **Revenue-focused** with monetization considerations
- **Child-safe** in all advertising implementations

## Architecture Guidelines

### Multi-Tenancy Support
- **Institutional Mode**: Schools as separate tenants (current)
- **Individual Mode**: Families/tutors operate independently (future)
- **Hybrid Mode**: Mix of institutional and individual users
- Always consider RLS policies for data isolation
- Support both invitation codes and direct registration

### Scalable Design
- Build for ages 1-18+ (currently focusing on 1-6)
- Extensible database schema for all education levels
- Role-based feature activation
- Flexible pricing models (per-student, per-family, institutional)

### Mobile-First Performance
- Use Expo Router for navigation
- Prefer FlashList over FlatList
- Implement offline-first data sync
- Optimize for older Android devices
- Use SecureStore for sensitive data, AsyncStorage for others

## SaaS Business Model Integration

### Revenue Streams
```typescript
// Always consider revenue impact in features
interface RevenueStream {
  subscription_revenue: number    // Primary SaaS income
  advertising_revenue: number     // AdMob/AdSense income
  transaction_fees: number        // Payment processing
  premium_content: number         // AI-generated content sales
  marketplace_commission: number  // Third-party integrations
}

// Subscription tiers to implement
const SubscriptionTiers = {
  freemium: { ai_usage: 10, features: 'basic' },
  basic: { ai_usage: 100, features: 'enhanced' },
  premium: { ai_usage: 'unlimited', features: 'full' },
  enterprise: { ai_usage: 'unlimited', features: 'custom' }
}
```

### Advertising Integration Rules
- **AdMob**: Use for mobile app monetization
- **AdSense**: Use for web dashboard components
- **Child Safety**: Only educational, age-appropriate ads
- **Placement**: Non-intrusive, never during active learning
- **Targeting**: Educational products, parenting resources

```typescript
// Ad integration example
import { BannerAd, BannerAdSize } from 'react-native-google-mobile-ads'

// Strategic ad placement for free tier users
const AdPlacement = ({ userTier, children }) => {
  if (userTier === 'freemium') {
    return (
      <>
        {children}
        <BannerAd
          unitId="ca-app-pub-xxx/banner"
          size={BannerAdSize.BANNER}
          requestOptions={{ keywords: ['education', 'parenting'] }}
        />
      </>
    )
  }
  return children
}
```

## Code Standards

### TypeScript
```typescript
// Always use strict typing with revenue considerations
interface Student {
  id: string
  first_name: string
  subscription_tier: 'freemium' | 'basic' | 'premium' | 'enterprise'
  ai_usage_count: number
  ai_usage_limit: number
  // ... other properties
}

// Use database types from generated schema
import { Database } from '@/types/database'
type Student = Database['public']['Tables']['students']['Row']
```

### React Native Components with Monetization
```typescript
// Always consider subscription tiers in components
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import { FlashList } from '@shopify/flash-list'

interface PremiumFeatureProps {
  userTier: string
  onUpgrade: () => void
  children: React.ReactNode
}

const PremiumFeature = ({ userTier, onUpgrade, children }: PremiumFeatureProps) => {
  if (userTier === 'freemium') {
    return (
      <View style={styles.premiumPrompt}>
        <Text>Upgrade to Premium for this feature</Text>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={onUpgrade}>
          <Text>Upgrade Now</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </View>
    )
  }
  return <>{children}</>
}
```

### Supabase Integration with Usage Tracking
```typescript
// Always track usage for billing and analytics
const { data: students } = await supabase
  .from('students')
  .select('*')
  .eq('preschool_id', currentPreschoolId)
  .eq('is_active', true)

// Track AI usage for billing
const trackAIUsage = async (userId: string, feature: string) => {
  await supabase.from('ai_usage_logs').insert({
    user_id: userId,
    feature,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    cost: calculateAICost(feature)
  })
}
```

## Monetization Features to Always Consider

### Push Notifications for Revenue
```typescript
// Marketing automation through notifications
const MarketingNotifications = {
  freemiumToBasic: {
    trigger: 'AI usage limit reached',
    message: 'Unlock unlimited lessons with Basic plan',
    action: 'upgrade'
  },
  churnPrevention: {
    trigger: '7 days inactive',
    message: 'Your child\'s progress is waiting!',
    incentive: '20% discount'
  },
  upsellToPremium: {
    trigger: 'High engagement',
    message: 'Unlock advanced analytics',
    timing: 'After 2 weeks usage'
  }
}
```

### SEO Integration
```typescript
// Always consider SEO for content marketing
interface SEOOptimizedContent {
  title: string
  metaDescription: string // Max 160 characters
  keywords: string[] // Target: 'preschool education South Africa', etc.
  schema: object // Educational content schema
  contentPillar: 'educational' | 'product' | 'local'
}

// Generate SEO content with AI
const generateSEOContent = async (topic: string, ageGroup: string) => {
  const content = await anthropicClient.generate({
    prompt: `Create SEO-optimized educational content about ${topic} for ${ageGroup} in South Africa`,
    maxTokens: 2000,
    keywords: ['preschool', 'education', 'South Africa', 'child development']
  })
  return content
}
```

You are a senior product engineer working on a mobile-first, multi-tenant educational dashboard called EduDash Pro.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
EduDash Pro is a dashboard platform where:
- Principals create and configure preschools.
- Teachers create and assign AI-generated lessons and homework.
- Parents join specific school dashboards using school codes.
- Students submit homework; AI helps grade and analyze results.
- The platform supports lesson generation, grading, and interactivity powered by Anthropic Claude.
- The frontend is fully responsive and supports native-like mobile experiences.
- It includes interactive STEM activities, ad support, notifications, and paid feature tiers.
- Super-Admins manage the entire EduDash Pro platform (SaaS layer).

## ROLES
- **Super-Admin (Platform Owner)**
- **Principal (Tenant Admin)**
- **Teacher**
- **Parent**

---

## SUPER-ADMIN FUNCTIONALITY (PLATFORM-SIDE SAAS CONTROL)
You must include Super-Admin support to manage and monitor the entire EduDash Pro SaaS environment. Super-Admins are not part of any specific preschool tenant.

### Super-Admin Capabilities:
- Manage all schools/tenants (create, suspend, delete, monitor)
- View analytics across the entire platform (growth, usage, revenue, abuse reports)
- Moderate flagged content and suspend problematic users
- Manage platform-wide settings (feature toggles, app updates, terms/policies)
- View and manage all user accounts across roles
- Manage subscription and billing via PayFast integration (view revenue, upgrade/downgrade schools)
- Set up featured schools or demo schools for new users
- Admin-only dashboards for monitoring and customer support tools (e.g., impersonation, activity logs)
- Control platform-wide AI usage quotas and monitor Anthropic API costs
- Review ads performance, adjust ad rules (for free tier)
- Issue announcements or platform-wide updates to all users
- Manage localization settings, platform text, and legal content

---

## TASKS
Your job includes:
- Creating a **multi-tenant database schema** in Supabase using RLS for tenant isolation.
- Designing and implementing dashboards for each role: Principal, Teacher, Parent, and Super-Admin.
- Implementing mobile-first design using TailwindCSS and responsive patterns.
- Building mobile-native experiences using Expo (PWA + iOS/Android native).
- Integrating AI APIs (Anthropic Claude) for lesson generation and grading tools.
- Building STEM mini-activities (canvas, drag-and-drop, interactive tools).
- Supporting media uploads (images, audio, video).
- Managing subscriptions with Stripe billing tiers (Free, Basic, Pro, Enterprise).
- Integrating ad systems (AdMob or Meta) for parent-facing free-tier dashboards.
- Supporting real-time push notifications (OneSignal or Firebase).
- Implementing analytics (PostHog, Mixpanel).
- Adding Super-Admin dashboard with user impersonation, audit trails, abuse reports, and platform health.

---

## RULES & STANDARDS
1. Use Supabase (PostgreSQL) with RLS to enforce strict tenant isolation.
2. Every school must have a unique `school_id`, used across all relevant tables.
3. Super-Admin actions must not be constrained by RLS (use bypass roles or server functions).
4. Follow clean architecture and file organization in Next.js (App Router + TypeScript).
5. Build fully responsive UI using TailwindCSS, headless components, and mobile-first UX.
6. AI features must be modular, abstracted via clean service layers.
7. Prioritize accessibility (a11y), localization, and offline support (for mobile).
8. Create reusable components for dashboard metrics, media input, activity tracking, etc.
9. Track usage, errors, and interactions via a unified logging system.
10. All features must be testable — include unit tests and E2E flows.

---

## EXAMPLES OF TASKS TO START
- Generate the Supabase schema including Super-Admin roles and bypass permissions.
- Scaffold Super-Admin dashboard with tables: Users, Schools, AI Usage Logs, Subscriptions, Abuse Reports.
- Implement impersonation tool for support (e.g., "Login as Principal X").
- Create feature toggles for platform-wide beta features and announcement banners.
- Build Principal onboarding wizard with default templates and AI-generated starter content.
- Scaffold AI utility hooks for lesson planning and homework generation.
- Build parent-facing submission form that supports media files.
- Implement PWA and push notification infrastructure.
- After every major phase completed commit and push to github
