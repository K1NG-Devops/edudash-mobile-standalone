## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

### What is Row Level Security?

Row Level Security (RLS) is a PostgreSQL feature that allows database administrators to control which rows a user can access or modify. It works by adding conditions to SQL queries that filter results based on the current user's permissions.

### Why RLS for Multi-Tenant Applications?

- **Tenant Isolation**: Ensures schools can only access their own data
- **Defense in Depth**: Security at the database level, not just application level
- **Compliance**: Helps meet data privacy regulations (POPIA, GDPR)
- **Zero Trust**: Even if application code has bugs, the database enforces security

## üèóÔ∏è RLS Policy Structure

### Policy Categories

1. **Self-Access Policies**: Users can access their own data
2. **Tenant-Scoped Policies**: Users can access data within their school
3. **Role-Based Policies**: Different permissions based on user role
4. **Superadmin Policies**: Platform administrators with full access

### Security Principles Applied

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users get minimum necessary access
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Permissions based on user roles
- **Tenant Isolation**: Schools cannot access other schools' data
- **Data Sovereignty**: Users own and control their data

---

## üîß Helper Functions

Our RLS implementation uses optimized helper functions to avoid circular dependencies:

### Core Functions

```sql
-- Get current user's role (cached)
public.get_current_user_role() ‚Üí TEXT

-- Get current user's school ID (cached)
public.get_current_user_preschool_id() ‚Üí UUID

-- Check if current user is superadmin
public.is_superadmin() ‚Üí BOOLEAN

-- Check if current user is school admin
public.is_school_admin() ‚Üí BOOLEAN

-- Check if current user is teacher
public.is_teacher() ‚Üí BOOLEAN

-- Check if user can access specific school
public.can_access_preschool(UUID) ‚Üí BOOLEAN
```

### Function Benefits

- **Performance**: `STABLE` functions are cached per query
- **Security**: `SECURITY DEFINER` ensures consistent execution
- **Maintainability**: Centralized logic for role checking

## üìä Policy Details by Table

### üë§ Users Table

**Security Goal**: Users can see their own profile + school members based on role

| Policy | Role | Action | Access |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| `users_read_own_profile` | All | SELECT | Own profile only |
| `users_update_own_profile` | All | UPDATE | Own profile only |
| `users_insert_own_profile` | All | INSERT | During signup only |
| `superadmins_access_all_users` | SuperAdmin | ALL | All users |
| `school_admins_read_preschool_users` | School Admin | SELECT | School users |
| `school_admins_create_preschool_users` | School Admin | INSERT | Teachers/Parents in school |
| `school_admins_update_preschool_users` | School Admin | UPDATE | Non-admin users in school |
| `teachers_read_preschool_users` | Teacher | SELECT | School users |

### üè´ Preschools Table

**Security Goal**: Users can only access their own school's information

| Policy | Role | Action | Access |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| `users_read_own_preschool` | All | SELECT | Own school only |
| `superadmins_access_all_preschools` | SuperAdmin | ALL | All schools |
| `school_admins_update_own_preschool` | School Admin | UPDATE | Own school only |

### üë∂ Students Table

**Security Goal**: Parents see their children, staff see school students

| Policy | Role | Action | Access |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| `parents_read_own_children` | Parent | SELECT | Own children only |
| `school_staff_read_preschool_students` | School Staff | SELECT | School students |
| `school_admins_manage_preschool_students` | School Admin | ALL | School students |
| `superadmins_manage_all_students` | SuperAdmin | ALL | All students |

### üìö Lessons Table

| Policy | Role | Action | Access |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| `anyone_read_public_lessons` | All | SELECT | Public lessons |
| `users_read_preschool_lessons` | All | SELECT | School/global lessons |
| `teachers_manage_preschool_lessons` | Teachers/Admins | ALL | School lessons |
| `superadmins_manage_all_lessons` | SuperAdmin | ALL | All lessons |

### üí∞ Payment Tables

## üß™ Security Testing

### Automated Testing

We've created comprehensive test scripts that:

1. **Create minimal test data** with clear "DELETE ME" markers
2. **Test tenant isolation** by attempting cross-tenant access
3. **Verify role-based permissions** across all user types
4. **Check for security vulnerabilities** like overly permissive policies
5. **Automatically clean up** all test data after completion

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run the RLS security test suite
psql -f supabase/migrations/20250806_secure_rls_policies.sql
psql -f test_rls_policies.sql
```

### Test Coverage

- ‚úÖ Helper function existence
- ‚úÖ RLS policy creation
- ‚úÖ RLS enablement on tables
- ‚úÖ Tenant isolation validation
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control
- ‚úÖ Dangerous policy detection
- ‚úÖ Automatic test data cleanup

---

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Supabase project with service role access
- PostgreSQL 12+ with RLS support
- Existing EduDash Pro database schema

### Deployment Steps

1. **Backup Current Database**
   ```bash
   pg_dump your_database > backup_before_rls.sql
   ```

2. **Apply RLS Policies**
   ```bash
   # Run the main RLS migration
   psql -f supabase/migrations/20250806_secure_rls_policies.sql
   ```

3. **Verify Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Run security tests
   psql -f test_rls_policies.sql
   ```

4. **Update Application Code** (if needed)
   - Ensure app uses authenticated users
   - Update any admin functions to work with RLS
   - Test all user flows

### Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can temporarily disable RLS:

```sql
-- EMERGENCY: Disable RLS (use with caution!)
ALTER TABLE public.users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.preschools DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ... repeat for other tables

-- Then restore from backup if needed
```

---

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Security Monitoring

1. **Policy Violations**: Monitor for RLS policy failures
2. **Performance Impact**: Watch for query performance changes
3. **User Access Patterns**: Audit unusual access attempts
4. **Helper Function Performance**: Monitor function execution times

### Regular Security Audits

Run these queries monthly:

```sql
-- Check for overly permissive policies
SELECT policyname, tablename 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE cmd LIKE '%USING (true)%' 
  AND tablename NOT IN ('lesson_categories');

-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT relname, relrowsecurity 
FROM pg_class 
WHERE relname IN ('users', 'students', 'preschools') 
  AND relrowsecurity = false;

-- Count policies per table
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
GROUP BY tablename 
ORDER BY policy_count;
```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Index Optimization**: Ensure indexes exist for RLS filter columns
2. **Function Caching**: Helper functions use `STABLE` for caching
3. **Query Planning**: Monitor execution plans for RLS-enabled queries
4. **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling to reduce function overhead

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Application Integration

1. **Always Use Authenticated Requests**: Never bypass authentication
2. **Validate User Context**: Ensure `auth.uid()` is set correctly
3. **Handle RLS Errors Gracefully**: Catch and handle permission errors
4. **Audit Trail**: Log security-relevant actions
5. **Regular Testing**: Test with different user roles regularly

### Database Maintenance

1. **Regular Backups**: Backup before any RLS changes
2. **Policy Documentation**: Document any custom policy changes
3. **Security Reviews**: Regular security audits and penetration testing
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for RLS policy violations
5. **Updates**: Keep PostgreSQL and Supabase updated
