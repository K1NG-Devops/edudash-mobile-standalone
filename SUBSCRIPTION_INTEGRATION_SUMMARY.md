// 2. Replace existing parent dashboard
<EnhancedSubscriptionParentDashboard
  userId={user.id}

```

### 2. Database Schema Requirements

The system requires these additional database tables (not created in this session):

CREATE TABLE usage_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  feature_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  feature_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Usage analytics (optional, for archival)
CREATE TABLE usage_logs_archive (
  -- Same structure as usage_logs for historical data
);
```

### 3. Environment Variables

```bash
# AdMob Configuration (for production)
EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMOB_APP_ID=ca-app-pub-xxx~xxx
EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMOB_BANNER_UNIT_ID=ca-app-pub-xxx/xxx
